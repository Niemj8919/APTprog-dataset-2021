## APTprog-dataset-2021

This dataset contains data provenance graphs collected on Windows 10.

We use SPADE to record data provenance graphs. For malicious samples, We simulated several APT attack scenes by using different C&C tools and CVE exploits. And for benign samples, we use 6 kinds of operation including Download, Webvideo, Livestream, Code, Music and Word.
